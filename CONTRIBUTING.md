How to contribute
-----------------

The preferred way to contribute to spafe is to fork the[main repository](https://github.com/SuperKogito/spafe) on GitHub:

1.	Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/SuperKogito/spafe): click on the 'Fork' button near the top of the page. This creates a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub server.

2.	Clone this copy to your local disk:

	-	Using SSH:

	```bash
	git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/spafe.git
	cd spafe
	```

	-	Using HTTPS&#x3A;

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/YourLogin/spafe.git
	cd spafe
	```

3.	Remove any previously installed spafe versions, then install your local copy with testing dependencies:

	```bash
	pip uninstall spafe
	pip install .
	```

4.	Create a branch to hold your changes:

	```bash
	git checkout -b my-feature
	```

5.	Start making changes.

	\`\``diff

	-	Please never work directly on the `master` branch!\`\`\`

6.	Once you are done, make sure to format the code using black to fit spafe's codestyle.

	\`\``black spafe/\`\`\`

7.	Make sure that the tests succeed and have enough coverage.

	\`\``pytest -x --cov-report term-missing --cov=spafe spafe/tests/test_*.py \`\`\`

8.	Use Git for the to do the version controlling of this copy. When you're done editing, you know the drill `add`, `commit` then `push`:

	```bash
	git add modified_files
	git commit
	```

	to record your changes in Git, push them to GitHub with:

	```bash
	git push -u origin my-feature
	```

9.	Finally, go to the web page of the your spafe fork repo, and click 'Pull request' button to send your changes to the maintainers to review.
